The key directories of this project are:

* [`/Documentation`](/Documentation): Additional (possibly out-of-date ðŸ˜¢)
  documentation.
* [`/programl/bin`](/programl/bin): Command line tools. All executable binaries
  are stored here.
* [`/programl/graph`](/programl/graph): Libraries for creating and manipulating
  the ProGraML graph representation.
